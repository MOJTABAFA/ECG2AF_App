*Revolutionizing ECG Data Analysis with Predictive Insights*

**Predicting Atrial Fibrillation Risk from ECG Data**  
This project showcases a simple web application that allows users to upload an ECG file in `.h5` format. Using the `ECG2AF` machine learning model, the app predicts the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) and displays the results to the user.

## üéØ Project Overview
The `ECG2AF` application is an innovative solution designed to facilitate the prediction of atrial fibrillation risk using advanced machine learning. It empowers users to easily upload ECG data and receive comprehensive predictions, aiding in proactive healthcare management. It serves as a practical example of deploying a clinical AI model for atrial fibrillation prediction. Users can upload ECG files, and the app will:

1. Process the ECG file using the pre-trained `ECG2AF` model.
2. Display four different prediction outputs related to AF risk.

This application aimed to demonstrate how to build a functional web application, handle machine learning model integration, and manage user-uploaded files, all while maintaining scalability for real-world usage.

## üåü Features

- **File Upload:** Users can upload `.h5` ECG files.
- **Model Integration:** Uses a pre-trained `ECG2AF` model to make AF predictions.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Displays prediction results in a clear, user-friendly format.
- **Error Handling:** Provides user feedback for invalid file formats or processing errors.
- **Scalability-Ready Design:** Easily adaptable for larger data volumes and concurrent users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)
- **Internet Connection** (to download dependencies)

---

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd ECG2AF_App
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies and isolate the project environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv ecg2af_env
source ecg2af_env/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
ecg2af_env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

Use `uvicorn`, an ASGI server, to run the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Step 5: Access the Web App

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You should see the upload interface for the ECG file.

## üìñ Usage

1. **Navigate to the Upload Page**: Go to the application‚Äôs homepage, where you'll find a form to upload your `.h5` ECG file.
2. **Upload ECG File**: Click on "Choose File" to select your `.h5` ECG file and then hit "Submit."
3. **View Prediction Results**: The app will process the file and display predictions in four output categories related to AF risk.

### Example:
After uploading an ECG file, you'll receive results similar to:

- **Output 1**: [Prediction Value]
- **Output 2**: [Prediction Value]
- **Output 3**: [Prediction Value]
- **Output 4**: [Prediction Value]

## üìà Scalability Plan
To meet the demands of large-scale data processing and support more users, this application can be scaled using a multi-pronged strategy. Leveraging technologies like Kubernetes for orchestrating containerized services ensures reliable scaling. Distributed data frameworks, such as Apache Spark, can be implemented for batch processing of extensive datasets, boosting processing efficiency. Additionally, using cloud solutions like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions enables on-demand serverless architecture, optimizing resource use and reducing costs.

To accommodate more users and analyze a larger volume of ECG data, here are suggested scalability strategies:

- **Batch Processing**: For high data volumes (e.g., 10,000 ECGs), implement batch processing using a distributed computing framework like Apache Spark or Dask 
(I really love Dask because it works so well with Python and can be easily set up on cloud platforms like Amazon AWS, Google GCP, and Microsoft Azure!). This will allow simultaneous analysis of multiple ECGs, increasing efficiency.

- **Cloud Hosting**: Deploy the app on a cloud platform, such as AWS or Google Cloud. Utilize cloud storage (like AWS S3) for file uploads to handle larger storage needs.
- **Load Balancing**: Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple server instances, ensuring that the app can handle a high volume of concurrent users without compromising performance.
- **Serverless Architecture**: For individual file processing, consider using serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) to scale on-demand based on file upload frequency.
